# Dev Scout

I wanted to build something that could find the developers who contributed the most to certain topics for a given repo. The demo is just for next.js, but this could be applied anywhere. 

For example, if you were using Next.js and were having issues or a bug with server actions, you could use this to find the right devs to reach out to. Didn't spend too much time on UI/UX but the core integration with [Greptile](https://greptile.com) is there.
